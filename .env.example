# JavManager test-only environment variables
#
# - Project configuration should live in `JavManager/appsettings.json` (and optionally `appsettings.Development.json`)
# - Environment variables are only for temporary testing overrides.
#
# Copy this file to `.env.dev` (gitignored) and fill in the values you need.
#
# NOTE:
# `JAVMANAGER_` prefix and `__` nesting are used by the app's config loader.
